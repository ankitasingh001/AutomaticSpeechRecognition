Speaker information has been used for generating CMVN features as in the following line of code:

feats="ark,s,cs:apply-cmvn $cmvn_opts --utt2spk=ark:$sdata/JOB/utt2spk scp:$sdata/JOB/cmvn.scp scp:$sdata/JOB/feats.scp ark:- | add-deltas $delta_opts ark:- ark:- |"

Epstral mean and variance normalization (CMVN) is generally done on a per-speaker basis.If all speakers are unique this parameter does not have any likely significance.
